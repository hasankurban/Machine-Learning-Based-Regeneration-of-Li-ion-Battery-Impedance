# Empirical Impedance data sets

- Empirical Impedance data were obtained by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy set up (Gamry REF3000AE Potentiostat and Echem Analyst).

- The experimental impedance data were collected in cell potentials as 3.2V, 3.4V, 3.6V, 3.8V, 4.0V, and 4.2V (corresponding state of charge values: 0%, 3%, 8%, 40%, 78%, 100%).
